PageOneX in Ruby on Rails
=========================

*PageOneX is an open source tool to code, analyze and visualize the evolution of stories on newspaper front pages.* In the future it will allow to compare newspaper with social media coverage. Newspaper front pages are a key source of data about our media ecology. Newsrooms spend massive time and effort deciding what stories make it to the front page. PageOneX makes coding and visualizing newspaper front page content much easier, democratizing access to newspaper attention data.

*How is your project different from what already exists?*
Communication researchers have analyzed newspaper front pages for decades, using slow, laborious methods. PageOneX simplifies, digitizes, and distributes the process across the net.
