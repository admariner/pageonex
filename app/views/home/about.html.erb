	<h1>PageOneX in Ruby on Rails</h1>
	<h2>Analyzing front pages.</h2>
	<br>
	<p>PageOneX is an open source tool to code, analyze and visualize the evolution of stories on newspaper front pages. In the future it will allow to compare newspaper with social media coverage.. Newspaper front pages are a key source of data about our media ecology. Newsrooms spend massive time and effort deciding what stories make it to the front page. PageOneX makes coding and visualizing newspaper front page content much easier, democratizing access to newspaper attention data.</p>

	<p>How is your project different from what already exists? Communication researchers have analyzed newspaper front pages for decades, using slow, laborious methods. PageOneX simplifies, digitizes, and distributes the process across the net.</p>

	<p>What has been built? A semi-automated version of the tool has been tested, and we have produced several interesting examples: <a href="http://numeroteca.org/cat/frontpage-newspaper/" title="">http://numeroteca.org/cat/frontpage-newspaper/</a>. 

	The first version of the tool, <a href="https://github.com/numeroteca/PageOneX" title="">https://github.com/numeroteca/PageOneX</a>, scrapes front pages from the web (kiosko.net) and builds the matrix of images that must be manually coded in inkscape.</p>

	<p>This summer, we are building a prototype web-based version with the support of the Google Summer of Code programm (GSOC).</p>

	<p>This is a project by Pablo Rey Maz√≥n, <a href="https://github.com/numeroteca" title="">https://github.com/numeroteca</a>. Ahmd Refat, <a href="https://github.com/ahmdrefat" title="">https://github.com/ahmdrefat</a>, is coding, thanks to GSOC; Sasha Costanza-Chock and Nathan Mathias are giving advice and supporting from the Center for Civic Media at MIT Media Lab.</p>

	<p>Check for updates about the project at <a href="http://montera34.org/pageonex/" title="">http://montera34.org/pageonex/</a> and in Twitter @pageonex</p>

	<p>Soon we will be using <a href="http://pageonex.com" title="">http://pageonex.com</a> to provide all the info re: the project.</p>
